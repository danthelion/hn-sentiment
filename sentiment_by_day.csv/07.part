Never noticed or knew that Hollywood went into such details with the &quot;Easter eggs&quot; back then so next time watching it will look out for them.<p>As also mentioned here, its up there with War Games, Tron and The Lawn Mower Man when considering the biological &amp; chemical knowledge we have at our fingertips today.",2022-05-14 22:34:59,POSITIVE

31385439,"All the oceanic crust is made of basalt, so approximately 2&#x2F;3 of the planet is covered by several miles of it. Unfortunately mining oceanic crust is impractical, for obvious reasons. However some oceanic crust got trapped between mountain ranges during continental collision, forming ophiolites. These can be suitable mining sites, together with LIPs (large igneous provinces) and the rocks of some shoshonitic (K-rich) basalt  volcanoes.",2022-05-15 05:19:21,NEGATIVE
