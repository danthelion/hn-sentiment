31651837,"My projects have no front-end engineer, however. The frontend is written in Rust as well and also uses Maud for HTML templating.<p>And I dispute it not working with complicated HTML templates, that&#x27;s handling it fine and integrates very well since I share code between frontend and backend anyway.",2022-06-07 09:39:18,POSITIVE

31655145,"&gt; But lets look at the syllabus for a 10 week quarter for the first UW CS course, Foundations of Computing [1] which also expects the students to layout their homework (proofs) in LaTex.<p>Your argument might make more sense if 311 were the first CS course, but it&#x27;s not. You can easily verify that by looking at the course listings which reveals it has a prereq, CSE143, which has a prereq of CSE142. So short of skipping those, it&#x27;s the third course at the earliest.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;w",2022-06-07 14:47:46,NEGATIVE
